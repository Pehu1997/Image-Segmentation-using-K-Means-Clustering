# Image-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
Image Segmentation: In computer vision (CV), image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments. The goal of segmenting an image is to change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. It is usually used for locating objects and creating boundaries. 

It is not a great idea to process an entire image because many parts in an image may not contain any useful information. Therefore, by segmenting the image, we can make use of only the important segments for processing. 

An image is basically a set of given pixels. In image segmentation, pixels which have similar attributes are grouped together. Image segmentation creates a pixel-wise mask for objects in an image which gives us a more comprehensive and granular understanding of the object.
